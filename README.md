# Goup

`goup` (pronounced Go Up) is an elegant Go version manager.

It is notorious that an operating system's package manager takes time to update Go to the latest version, particularly on Linux distros.
At the time of this writing in October 2020, Fedora 32's Go version from [dnf](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DNF) is 1.14.9, while the latest Go version is 1.15.2.

There are a bunch of solutions to install Go or manage Go versions outside of a package manager:
[golang/dl](https://github.com/golang/dl), [getgo](https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/cmd/getgo), [gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm), [goenv](https://github.com/syndbg/goenv), to name a few.
All of them either do not work well on all Linux distros (I ran into errors with `gvm` and `goenv` on Fedora) or do not provide the developer experience that I like (`golang/dl` requires a Go compiler to pre-exist; `getgo` can only install the latest Go)

I want a Go version manager that:

* Has a minimum prerequisite to install, e.g., does not need a Go compiler to pre-exist.
* Is installed with a one-liner.
* Runs well on all operating systems (at least runs well on *uix as a start).
* Installs any version of Go (any version from [golang.org/dl](https://golang.org/dl) or tip) and switches to it.
* Does not inject magic into your shell.
* Is written in Go.

`goup` is an attempt to fulfill the above features and is heavily inspired by [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/), [golang/dl](https://github.com/golang/dl) and [getgo](https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/cmd/getgo).

## Installation

### One-liner

```
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owenthereal/goup/master/install.sh | sh
```

Install by skipping the confirmation prompt, e.g., for automation:

```
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owenthereal/goup/master/install.sh | sh -s -- '--skip-prompt'
```

### With Go Toolchain

```
go install github.com/owenthereal/goup/cmd/goup@latest
```

### Manual

If you want to install manually, there are the steps:

* Download the latest `goup` from https://github.com/owenthereal/goup/releases
* Drop the `goup` executable to your `PATH` and make it executable: `mv GOUP_BIN /usr/local/bin/goup && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/goup`
* Add the Go bin directory to your shell startup script: `echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.go/current/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc`

```

## How it works

* `install.sh` downloads the latest Goup release for your platform and appends Goup's bin directory (`$HOME/.go/bin`) & Go's bin directory (`$HOME/.go/current/bin`) to your PATH environment variable.
* `goup` switches to selected Go version.
* `goup set` switches to selected Go version.
* `goup install` downloads specified version of Go to`$HOME/.go/VERSION` and symlinks it to `$HOME/.go/current`.
* `goup ls` list all installed Go version located at `$HOME/.go/current`.
* `goup remove` removes the specified Go version.
* `goup search` lists all available Go versions from https://golang.org/dl.
* `goup upgrade` upgrades goup.
